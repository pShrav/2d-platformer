# 2D Platformer

Source code for a Unity Platformer game where you defeat enemies to finish levels (https://shravani.itch.io/2d-platformer).

<b>Gameplay:</b> The character loses a life upon colliding with an enemy, and respawns if there are lives left. Enemies can be defeated if the player jumps on them, and a level is complete once all its enemies have been defeated. The game currently only has three levels (more levels coming soon!).

<b>Controls:</b> WASD to move and Space to Jump (the screen wraps horizontally and vertically).
